; Stack Graphs for Scala
;
; Adapted from tree-sitter-stack-graphs-java/src/stack-graphs.tsg
; Using tree-sitter-scala/queries/tags.scm for node types and captures
;
; This builds a basic stack graph for symbol definitions and scopes in Scala.
; Scopes are represented by body nodes (e.g., class_body, block).
; Symbols are graph nodes with path and kind attributes.
; Edges: scope -> symbol [definition/reference]
;        parent_scope -> child_scope [pre]
;
; Note: This is a simplified version focusing on definitions and basic scopes.
; Imports, qualified references, and advanced features like given/extension are basic or omitted.
; References are basic for identifiers outside defs.

; Globals for symbol kinds (inherited or defined as needed)
global symbol_kinds

; Path separator for qualified paths
global path_separator = "."

; Root scope: the source file
(source_file) @file {
  node file
  attr (file) kind = "module"
}

; Package declaration: defines package symbol in file scope, package node as scope
(source_file
  (package_declaration
    name: (identifier) @pkg.name ) @pkg ) @file {
  ; Define package symbol in file scope
  let parent = @file
  let symbol = (node @pkg.name)
  attr (symbol) kind = "definition"
  attr (symbol) path = @pkg.name
  edge parent -> symbol [definition]
  ; Package as scope
  let scope = @pkg
  attr (scope) kind = "package"
  edge parent -> scope [pre]
}

; Import: basic simple import as reference in current scope (file/package)
(source_file
  (import_declaration
    . (identifier) @imp.name ) @imp ) @file {
  let scope = @file  ; or capture package if inside
  let symbol = (node @imp.name)
  attr (symbol) kind = "reference"
  attr (symbol) path = @imp.name
  edge scope -> symbol [reference]
}

; Class declaration: define class symbol in parent, scope = class_body
(source_file

  let parent = @cbody
  let symbol = (node @def.name)
  attr (symbol) kind = "definition"
  attr (symbol) path = @def.name

; Similar for other parameters in class/trait/etc. - omitted for brevity, pattern same.

(class_declaration  ; example for class, similar for others
  body: (class_body @parent
    (method_declaration

(class_declaration
  body: (class_body @parent
    (field_declaration

  let symbol = (node @def.name)
  attr (symbol) kind = "definition"
  attr (symbol) path = @def.name
  edge scope_parent -> symbol [definition]
}

; Val declaration (local or member)
; For member in class:
(class_declaration
  body: (class_body @parent
    (val_declaration
      name: (identifier) @def.name ) @val ) ) @class {
  let scope_parent = @parent
  let symbol = (node @def.name)
  attr (symbol) kind = "definition"
  attr (symbol) path = @def.name
  edge scope_parent -> symbol [definition]
}

; Similar for var_declaration

; Pattern binding (local def)
(block  ; example in block scope
  (pattern_binding
    name: (identifier) @def.name ) @pat ) @scope {

(method_declaration
  parameters: (parameter_list @parent
    (parameter
      name: (identifier) @def.name ) @param ) @method ) {

  attr (symbol) kind = "definition"
  attr (symbol) path = @def.name
  edge @parent -> symbol [definition]  ; params in function scope
}

; Lambda parameter
(lambda_expression
  (lambda_parameter

; Basic references: identifier not in definition contexts
; This is approximate; in practice, use specific for simple_identifier, qualified_identifier excluding defs
(identifier) @ref.name (#not-capture? @tag) {  ; assuming @tag are defs from tags.scm, but since separate query, use negation if possible
  ; To make it work, the query can be (identifier) @ref.name not in def patterns, but tree-sitter query supports anchors or separate.
  ; For simple, assume a stanza for potential refs
  let scope = enclosing_scope_capture  ; but to implement, need to capture the current scope body
  ; For example, for identifier in block:
  (block (identifier) @ref.name ) @scope {
    let scope = @scope
    let symbol = (node @ref.name)
    attr (symbol) kind = "reference"
    attr (symbol) path = @ref.name
    edge scope -> symbol [reference]
  }
  ; Similar for other expression contexts: expression, infix_expr, etc.
  ; Omitted for brevity, add as needed for full coverage.
}

; Add more for qualified references, building path with path_separator, etc.
; For example, for qualified_identifier: (qualified_identifier . (identifier) @qual ) build path = prev.path + separator + @qual
